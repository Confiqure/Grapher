Grapher
=======

This is a simple graphing application I made to track simple linear trends of data and very easily analyze intercepts and intersections for data collection.

Example command line execution:
java -jar Grapher.jar true 500,500 Test_Graph {PersonA,3x+6,yellow} {PersonB,2.5x+11,green}
